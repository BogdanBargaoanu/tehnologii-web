            <p>Through Bob Marley's respect for nature and humanity, this helped guide his life, his legacy is as a
                force for global good is carried on by his family and manifested in every cup of Marley Coffee.
                Together, they want to share the legacy by uniting people from all over the world over coffee. The son
                of legendary late musician Bob Marley started a coffee company in 2009 with only 25 acres of farmland in
                Jamaica and a team vision to support the farmers and their communities.</p>

            <p>Discovered in 990 AD in Ethiopia, coffee farming has been a longstanding tradition in communities all
                over the world. As the second most valuable commodity exported from developing countries, the importance
                of supporting this agricultural sector is a priority. When you buy a Marley Coffee, you help to provide
                long-term sustainability for workers putting their love and dedication into our coffee.</p>

            <p>The FAIRTRADE Mark means that the ingredients in our products have been produced by small-scale farming
                organizations, or plantations that meet Fairtrade social, economic, and environmental standards. These
                standards include protection of workers' rights and the environment, proper use of the Fairtrade Minimum
                Price and an additional Fairtrade Premium to invest in business or community projects.</p>

            <p>Organic certified, sustainably grown and ethically farmed. The coffee is made with love to unite people
                around the world. Feel as good about the cup of coffee in your hand as the people who picked it. The
                Marley Coffee Founding Partners are committed to giving back to the community. We do this through a
                combination of supporting coffee farmers in Jamaica, supporting youth programs, and supporting
                education.</p>
